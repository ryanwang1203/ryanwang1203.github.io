## About Me

I am a first‑year Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at **Santa Clara University**, advised by **Dr. Jun Wang**.
My research explores the intersection of **Generative AI** and **computational mechanics**, aiming to automate the design of high‑performance metamaterials for automotive and aerospace applications.

Previously, I earned an **M.S. in Imaging Science** from *Washington University in St. Louis*, where I worked on super‑resolution ultrasound imaging pipelines and vision‑based Alzheimer’s screening.

Outside the lab, you’ll find me composing on the piano, perfecting latte art, or walking my miniature long‑haired dachshund, **Lucky**.
