## About Me

Hi! I’m a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/wang-jun/">Dr. Jun Wang</a>. My research focuses on AI for Mechanical Design and Geometric Simulation.
In industry, I’ve worked on knowledge graph-powered AI chatbots at <strong>Lenovo</strong>, where I received the VP Instant Award for AI innovation 
      (<a href="/files/VPaward.pdf">certificate</a>). I also published research on Jingdong’s self-built logistics system in 
      <a href="https://bcpublication.org/index.php/BM/article/view/3751">BCPublication</a>.  
Outside the lab, I enjoy playing piano and guitar, swimming, and walking my dog, Lucky.
